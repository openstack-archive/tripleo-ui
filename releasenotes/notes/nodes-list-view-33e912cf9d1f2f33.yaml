    Nodes listing has been reworked, it now provides 2 separate views which
    can be changed via toolbar content view switcher. Default nodes listing
    is using ListView component instead of table. New nodes listing provides
    information about node in more user friendly way. Actions on selected nodes
    are triggered using action buttons in Nodes toolbar.
