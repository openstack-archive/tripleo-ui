    Nodes Assignment Modal has been removed and replaced by 2 separate steps.
    Assigning Node to a Role is now done by tagging node to a certain Flavor
    in Nodes view. This Flavor then needs to be set in Role configuration.
    Based on this, count of available Nodes are provided in Deployment Plan
    page and it is possible to set counts of Nodes intended to be deployed
    with Roles.
