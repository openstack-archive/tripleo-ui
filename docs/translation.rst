Translation
===========

Tripleo UI uses the react-intl package for translation.

Adding translateable strings
----------------------------

Strings are prepared for translation using react-intl's ``defineMessages``
API. Check out ``./src/js/components/deployment_plan/`` for examples.

Extracting messages from components
-----------------------------------

Messages are extracted during the build process (``npm run build``) and stored
in the ``./i18n/extracted-messages/`` folder. These files can be converted into
a single ``.pot`` file with this command:

::

    npm run json2pot

The resulting file (``./i18n/messages.pot``) can be uploaded to
`Zanata`_ to create/update the translation. (Note: translations for the
TripleO UI are synced from the `OpenStack Zanata`_ instance.)

.. _Zanata: http://zanata.org
.. _OpenStack Zanata: https://translate.openstack.org/project/view/tripleo-ui

Using translated ``.po`` files
------------------------------

The translated language file (``messages.po``) then needs to be converted into
one JSON file per language (Japanese in this example):

::

    npm run po2json -- ./i18n/ja.po -o ./i18n/locales/ja.json


Adding a new language
---------------------

When a new language is added, we need to update the ``src/constants/i18n.js``
file with the name and abbreviation of the language.
